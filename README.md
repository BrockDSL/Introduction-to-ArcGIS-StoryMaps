Introduction:  
On the 22nd of June, 1813, Laura was busy tending to the militia bunking at her homestead in the small town of Queenston. Being a woman, she was not suspected of espionage and so she learned of a sneak attack the Americans were planning later that week in Thorold. With her husband unwell, Laura resolutely decided to make the treacherous journey on her own to warn Lt. Fitzgibbon and save Upper Canada.

> It must've been early in the morning on June 22nd, 1813 that Laura headed out to save her country. Being a woman wouldn't cause suspicion in her travels and some say that she brought her cow along for the journey... at least part of it. No doubt, she hurried to her relatives' home in St. Davids where she would've sought the help of her half-brother, Charles. However, Charles was sick and so Laura's niece, Elizabeth offered to accompany her. And off they went to Homer.
