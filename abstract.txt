Join us on the continuing journey of Laura Secord as we introduce you to the basics of creating an ArcGIS StoryMap. Using this web-based story-telling tool, you will be able to share narrative, videos, images and maps to your audience. ArcGIS StoryMaps is a wonderful platform for sharing a variety of content. You are encouraged to use this tool as an alternative to other webpage development tools and itâ€™s absolutely free!

No experience with Storymaps in needed for this session.
