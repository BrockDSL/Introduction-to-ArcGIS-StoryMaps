Being a woman wouldn't cause suspicion in her travels and some say that she brought her cow along for the journey... at least part of it. No doubt, she hurried to her relatives' home in St. Davids where she would've sought the help of her half-brother, Charles. However, Charles was sick and so Laura's niece, Elizabeth offered to accompany her. And off they went to Homer.
