# Introduction to ArcGIS StoryMaps
This workshop aims to introduce attendees to **ArcGIS StoryMaps**. This web service provides a platform for sharing maps, images, videos and narrative content with your peers and the world. 

The subject matter for this storymap includes multi-media pieces describing the treacherous journey Laura Secord took to save her country. To get a sense of the story, read this article by the late Alun Hughes [Following in Laura's Footsteps]( https://brocku.ca/social-sciences/geography/wp-content/uploads/sites/152/Following-in-Laura%E2%80%99s-Footsteps.pdf) and watch this brief Heritage Minute on YouTube: [https://youtu.be/_L-vL5NFkYA](https://youtu.be/_L-vL5NFkYA)
